            In this application, we aim to tackle the lack of sustainability on both our central and Kings campus's at UOE. We realised that
            a good place to start with this would be to encourage both students and staff to recycle, and to aid their endeavors we created this
            web page to show those interested what local recycling facilities available as well as give them their closest recycling  bin to their 
            current location depending on what they intend to recycle 
        </p>
