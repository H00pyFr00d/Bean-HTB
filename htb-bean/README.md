# Find a Bin
## Description
Find a Bin is an Edinburgh based service for finding the nearest rubbish receptacle to dispose of a given type of litter!

We have found that oftentimes the major barrier to people properly disposing of their rubbish is not knowing where to properly dispose of it, leading to people improperly disposing of their litter. This is evidently not sustainable for the planet and so we sought to attempt the creation of an app to help inform people.

Using data from the [Edinburgh City Council](https://data.edinburghcouncilmaps.info/datasets/ddb5fcb791634729b4b4d3d1e5b8aa05/explore) we built an app to help Edinburgh Students on the Central and Kings campuses find nearby bins for their litter.

## How to Use
The service is fairly simple, just go to [[Insert Link Here]] and click on the "Find a Bin" tab, select the campus and rubbish type, and then the map will show you the path to the nearest bin!
